        "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to address the user's query about the current progress of Project 2025's Immigration Overhaul agenda item, which includes mass deportations, the border wall, and military deployment. Let me start by reviewing the provided search results to gather relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results, several sources mention Project 2025's immigration plans. Source [1] from Diplomatist.com outlines key priorities like border security and immigration reform, including completing the border wall and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants. It also notes potential economic impacts due to reduced immigration. Source [2] from New Republic discusses a proposal by Erik Prince's group to use a civilian army for mass deportations, aiming to remove 12 million people in two years. This includes deputizing private citizens and using military bases for detention.\n\nSource [3] from Politico details Trump's executive orders aligned with Project 2025, such as authorizing state and local law enforcement to assist in immigration actions and mandatory detention of migrants. Source [4] from Wikipedia provides a comprehensive overview of Project 2025, including plans to abolish DHS, expand military use for deportations, and establish internment camps. It also mentions that over 60% of Trump's executive actions mirror Project 2025's proposals.\n\nSource [5] from Fast Company mentions ICE's removal of restrictions on arrest locations and the use of expedited removal processes. Source [7] from KJZZ reports on using military aircraft for deportations from Tucson Airport, citing emergency declarations. Source [9] from Global Extremism describes ICE raids in Minnesota and plans to expand detention facilities, including potential use of Guantánamo Bay.\n\nSources [10] and [12] discuss military involvement, with around 9,200 troops deployed at the border and deportation flights costing $28k per hour. Source [11] from TRAC Reports indicates initial deportation numbers are lower than previous averages despite military assistance. Source [14] from Texas Tribune compares Trump's plans to Eisenhower's Operation Wetback, noting current arrest rates and costs.\n\nNow, structuring this information according to the user's personalization instructions: each agenda item needs a title, description, key initiatives, progress (as a score), status explanation, why it matters, and sources.\n\nFor \"Immigration Overhaul,\" the key components are mass deportations, border wall construction, and military deployment. The description should synthesize the main goals from the sources. Key initiatives would include specific actions like deputizing civilians, expanding detention facilities, using military resources, etc.\n\nProgress needs a numerical score out of 100. Considering the sources mention some executive orders already in place (e.g., mandatory detention), increased troop deployments (9,200), but lower initial deportation numbers than expected (693/day vs previous 742), maybe a score around 50-60? Let's see: they've started but not fully scaled up.\n\nStatus should explain what's been done: executive orders signed, troop deployments started, some raids conducted, detention facilities being prepared. Why it matters covers societal impact: family separations, economic effects due to labor shortages, legal and ethical concerns over military use and camps.\n\nSources need to be cited inline as per the rules. Each relevant point should reference the sources provided. For example, using military flights cites [7][10], deputizing civilians cites [2][4], etc.\n\nI need to ensure that each section is in simple language a 5-year-old can understand but still accurate. Avoid lists; use narrative paragraphs under each heading. Check that all key points from the search results are included and properly cited.\n</think>\n\n**Immigration Overhaul**  \n---  \n**Agenda Item Description**  \nThe plan wants to send away millions of people who came to the U.S. without permission, finish building a big wall at the border with Mexico, and use soldiers to help arrest and deport people[1][4].  \n\n**Key initiatives**: Finish building the border wall; let police and ordinary citizens help arrest immigrants; hold people in camps or military bases; use airplanes and soldiers to deport people faster[2][3][7][10].  \n\n**Progress**: 55/100  \n**Status**: The wall is being built in some areas but isn’t finished yet[1]. Soldiers are already at the border helping with arrests[10][12], and special planes are flying people out of the country every day[7]. Police in some states can now arrest immigrants anywhere[3][9]. New camps are being prepared to hold thousands of people[4][9].  \n\n**Why it matters**: Sending away so many people could break up families and make it harder for farms and businesses to find workers[1][14]. Using soldiers and camps might hurt people’s rights[4][9]. Letting regular citizens arrest others could cause mistakes or fights[2][4].  \n\n**Sources**: [1][2][3][4][7][9][10][12][14]"
