It went up by over 12% recently but then faced some resistance around $120. This means it's hard for Solana to go much higher unless many more people start buying it[4].\n\n## Update 2: ETF Speculation Drives Price\nThere's a lot of talk about a Solana ETF (a special kind of fund). This talk is making people excited about buying Solana, and its price has gone up. Some big companies are hoping this ETF will get approved soon[2].\n\n## Update 3: Market Volatility\nSolana's price has been moving up and down a lot because of big changes in the market. Sometimes it gets close to $100, but then it jumps back up. This volatility makes it hard to predict what will happen next[1][3].\n\n## Update 4: Technical Analysis\nSolana recently broke through some important resistance levels, which means it could keep going up if people keep buying. However, if it goes back down, it might fall to around $95 or even lower[3][5].\n\n## Update 5: Adoption and Competition\nSolana is still popular for its fast transactions and low fees. However, it faces competition from other blockchains like Ethereum. Solana needs to keep improving to stay competitive in the crypto world[1][3].\n\n**Sources**: [1][2][3][4][5]"
