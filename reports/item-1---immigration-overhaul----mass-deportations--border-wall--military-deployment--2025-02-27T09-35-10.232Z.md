Okay, let's tackle this query about the current progress of Project 2025's Immigration Overhaul agenda item. The user wants to know about mass deportations, the border wall, and military deployment. First, I need to review the provided search results to gather relevant information.

Starting with mass deportations: Search result [1] mentions plans for arresting, detaining, and mass deportation of illegal immigrants using military and law enforcement. [2] talks about ICE removing restrictions on where they can conduct arrests and expanding expedited removal. [7] provides details on daily arrest quotas and costs, while [10] notes executive orders targeting noncitizens. [11] mentions ICE detention facilities being over capacity and considering tent facilities.

Next, the border wall: [1] and [6] discuss completing the border wall. [3] shows construction has resumed in Texas, New Mexico, and California. [8] gives specifics on miles built under Trump's first term and current efforts. [11] mentions funding in a Senate bill.

Military deployment: [4] and [12] detail deploying thousands of troops to the border and Guantanamo Bay. [1] mentions using National Guard and other agencies for enforcement. [7] notes Texas offering state resources to support deployments.

I need to structure each section with key initiatives, progress percentage, status updates, why it matters, and sources. Ensure clarity for a 5-year-old's understanding. Check all sources are cited correctly with brackets. Avoid lists, use concise language. Progress percentages should reflect current status based on the info—like construction resuming but not complete, deployments increasing but targets not fully met.

**Immigration Overhaul**  
---  
**Agenda Item Description**  
The Immigration Overhaul agenda aims to enforce strict border security through mass deportations, completing the border wall, and deploying military resources to curb illegal immigration[1][6][12].  

**Key initiatives**:  
- Arresting and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants[1][7].  
- Resuming and expanding construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall[3][8].  
- Deploying active-duty troops and National Guard units to assist with border enforcement[4][12].  
- Expanding detention facilities, including tent camps and repurposed military bases[2][11].  
- Withholding federal funds from states/localities that refuse immigration enforcement cooperation[1].  

**Progress**: 65  
**Status**:  
Construction crews have restarted work on the border wall in Texas, New Mexico, and California using funds from Trump’s first term[3][8]. Over 4,000 troops are already stationed at the border, with plans to deploy up to 10,000[4][12]. ICE has begun daily arrest quotas (600+ arrests/day) and is releasing detained migrants into monitoring programs due to overcrowded facilities[7][11]. Texas offered 1,400 acres of land for new detention camps[7].  

**Why it matters**:  
These policies could separate families, strain public services, and reduce workforce availability in key industries like agriculture[6]. Military involvement in domestic law enforcement raises constitutional concerns[4][12].
