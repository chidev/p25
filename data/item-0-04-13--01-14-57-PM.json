  "content": "# Current Progress of Project 2025: Dismantling Federal Agencies and Restructuring Government Functions  \n\nThe Trump administration has made significant strides in advancing Project 2025’s agenda to dismantle key federal agencies, including the Department of Education, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and components of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), while consolidating procurement functions under the General Services Administration (GSA). These efforts align with the broader conservative blueprint aimed at reducing federal oversight, decentralizing authority to states, and reorienting governmental priorities around ideological principles. Legal challenges, congressional actions, and operational disruptions have characterized the implementation process, with notable impacts on public services, regulatory frameworks, and civil liberties.  \n\n---\n\n## Dismantling the Department of Education  \n\n### Executive Actions and Workforce Reductions  \nPresident Trump’s March 20, 2025, executive order, *Improving Education Outcomes by Empowering Parents, States, and Communities*, directed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to initiate the dissolution of the Department of Education[15][16][17]. This order mandates the transfer of federal education authority to states and localities, emphasizing compliance with administration policies, including the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs[17]. By late March 2025, the department had already undergone a 50% workforce reduction, with layoffs targeting DEI-related roles and administrative staff[16]. Secretary McMahon outlined plans to reassign remaining functions—such as student financial aid and civil rights enforcement—to other agencies or state governments[17].  \n\n### Legal and Operational Challenges  \nThe administration’s reliance on executive authority to dismantle the department faces legal hurdles, as Congress retains statutory control over its existence[15]. Despite these challenges, the Trump administration has advanced deregulatory measures, including the rescission of Biden-era guidance on transgender student protections and Title IX enforcement[17]. The proposed elimination of federal oversight risks exacerbating disparities in resource allocation, particularly for low-income districts and students with disabilities, who rely on federal funding formulas and protections[14][17].  \n\n### Implications for Public Education  \nThe decentralization of education policy threatens to fragment accountability mechanisms, potentially leading to inequitable access to advanced coursework, special education services, and nutrition programs[14][16]. States adopting the administration’s model may prioritize voucher systems and charter schools, redirecting public funds away from traditional district schools[2][14]. Furthermore, the elimination of federal data collection initiatives could obscure performance metrics, hindering efforts to address achievement gaps[17].  \n\n---\n\n## Restructuring Homeland Security and Eliminating FEMA  \n\n### Dismantling DHS and Immigration Enforcement  \nProject 2025 envisions replacing DHS with a militarized immigration enforcement apparatus, a goal reflected in the Trump administration’s termination of humanitarian parole programs and expansion of deportation capabilities[9][13]. The February 2025 cancellation of the CHNV parole program stripped protections from 532,000 Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan migrants, rendering them deportable and ineligible for work permits[13]. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) removals under Trump have averaged 661 daily, lagging behind Biden-era figures but signaling intensified enforcement priorities[11].  \n\n### Targeting FEMA and Disaster Response  \nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced plans to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), despite bipartisan legislative efforts to elevate it to a Cabinet-level entity[10]. The administration’s 2025 continuing resolution allocated $22.5 billion to FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund, creating a paradox between stated abolition goals and operational funding[12]. This ambiguity has sowed confusion among state and local emergency managers, who rely on federal coordination during hurricanes, wildfires, and public health crises[10][18]. Privatization proposals for flood insurance and disaster recovery could shift costs to individuals and municipalities, disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities[18].  \n\n---\n\n## Dismantling the Environmental Protection Agency  \n\n### Regulatory Rollbacks and Research Cuts  \nThe EPA has undergone systematic deregulation, with Administrator Lee Zeldin overseeing the elimination of over 400 grants and the closure of the Office of Environmental Justice[5][19]. The March 2025 “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history” rescinded 30 rules governing air quality, toxic chemical exposure, and greenhouse gas emissions[19]. Simultaneously, the administration moved to shutter the Office of Research and Development (ORD), halting critical risk assessments for substances like formaldehyde and ethylene oxide[7][19]. These actions align with Project 2025’s characterization of EPA research as “precautionary, bloated, and politically driven”[7].  \n\n### Climate Policy Reversals  \nTrump’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and dismantling of the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon have dismantled federal climate mitigation frameworks[4][18]. Executive orders expediting Arctic drilling and suspending offshore wind leases prioritize fossil fuel extraction over renewable energy investments[5][18]. The elimination of NOAA’s climate research programs and censorship of the U.S. Global Change Research Program further erode public access to climate science[4][18].  \n\n### Impacts on Public Health and Environmental Justice  \nCommunities near industrial facilities face heightened exposure to pollutants due to relaxed emissions monitoring and enforcement[19]. The revocation of environmental justice initiatives disproportionately affects Black, Brown, and low-income populations, who are more likely to reside in proximity to Superfund sites and refineries[5][19]. Rural areas dependent on EPA grants for water infrastructure risk losing funding for lead pipe replacement and wastewater management[19].  \n\n---\n\n## Consolidating Federal Procurement Under the GSA  \n\n### Expansion of GSA’s Role  \nThe March 20, 2025, executive order *Eliminating Waste and Saving Taxpayer Dollars by Consolidating Procurement* designates the GSA as the primary acquirer of common goods and services, centralizing $750 billion in annual contracting[3][8]. Agencies must submit consolidation plans by May 19, 2025, with GSA tasked to finalize implementation strategies by June 18[8]. The order prioritizes Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs), phasing out agency-specific vehicles like NASA’s SEWP and NIH’s CIO-SP3[3].  \n\n### Risks and Transition Challenges  \nCentralization could streamline procurement processes but risks creating bottlenecks for specialized acquisitions, particularly in defense and healthcare[3][8]. Small businesses reliant on set-aside programs may face barriers to entry as contracting opportunities consolidate under fewer, larger vehicles[8]. The exemption of overseas operations from consolidation raises questions about interoperability between domestic and international supply chains[8].  \n\n---\n\n## Legislative Support and the Dismantling Government Act  \n\n### HR 1295 and Presidential Authority  \nThe House-approved Dismantling Government Act (HR 1295) grants President Trump filibuster-proof authority to restructure agencies through December 2026, circumventing traditional congressional oversight[6]. This legislation revives reorganization powers last used in 1984, enabling the elimination of statutory programs without standalone votes[6]. If enacted, the bill would facilitate the rapid dissolution of agencies targeted by Project 2025, including the Department of Education and EPA, by requiring only a simple majority Senate approval[6].  \n\n### Judicial and Political Resistance  \nFederal courts have temporarily halted aspects of the administration’s agenda, reinstating employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Voice of America[1]. Legal challenges to Schedule F workforce policies and agency abolitions are pending, with plaintiffs arguing violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and nondiscrimination statutes[1][7]. Congressional Democrats have denounced HR 1295 as a “Trojan horse” undermining checks and balances, though their ability to block it remains limited[6].  \n\n---\n\n## Conclusion  \n\nThe Trump administration’s execution of Project 2025’s agency dismantlement agenda has achieved rapid procedural progress but faces enduring legal and operational vulnerabilities. By leveraging executive orders, workforce reductions, and legislative maneuvering, the administration has reshaped federal priorities around deregulation, immigration enforcement, and state decentralization. However, the erosion of environmental protections, educational equity, and disaster readiness poses systemic risks to public welfare, while centralization of procurement and presidential authority challenges democratic accountability. Sustained judicial review and electoral outcomes will determine the permanence of these structural changes.\n---\n[1] https://www.govexec.com/transition/2025/04/project-2025-wanted-hobble-federal-workforce-doge-has-hastily-done-and-more/404390/\n\n[2] https://redwine.blue/project2025/\n\n[3] https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/03/trump-administration-to-consolidate-domestic-federal-procurement\n\n[4] https://time.com/7271567/trump-project-2025-anti-climate-action/\n\n[5] https://www.insidegovernmentcontracts.com/2025/04/timeline-of-key-developments-related-to-recent-executive-actions-as-of-april-2-2025/\n\n[6] https://www.commondreams.org/news/the-open-plot-to-dismantle-the-government\n\n[7] https://www.commondreams.org/news/trump-epa-head\n\n[8] https://www.insidegovernmentcontracts.com/2025/03/executive-order-issued-to-expand-gsas-role-in-acquisition-of-common-goods-and-services-and-information-technology/\n\n[9] https://glaad.org/project-2025/\n\n[10] https://www.govexec.com/management/2025/03/fema-set-elimination-noem-says-amid-bipartisan-house-reform-proposal/404008/\n\n[11] https://tracreports.org/reports/756/\n\n[12] https://www.bhfs.com/insights/alerts-articles/2025/senate-passes-continuing-resolution-avoids-shutdown\n\n[13] https://www.epi.org/policywatch/\n\n[14] https://whatisproject2025.net/about-project-2025/\n\n[15] https://www.advocate.com/politics/trump-orders-education-department-shut\n\n[16] https://people.com/education-department-executive-order-what-it-means-schools-11701420\n\n[17] https://educationcounsel.com/our_work/e-updates/all/e-update-for-march-31-2025\n\n[18] https://voices.earth/insights/fighting-for-the-planet-means-pushing-back-on-project-2025/\n\n[19] https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/2025/03/18/epa-deregulation/",
