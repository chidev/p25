  "content": "# Trade and Tariffs: Universal Baseline Tariffs and Targeting China  \n## Progress**: 85/100  \n\nThe Trump Administration's trade policy under Project 2025 has achieved significant milestones in restructuring U.S. import regulations, prioritizing the implementation of universal baseline tariffs and aggressive measures targeting China. As of April 13, 2025, a 10% baseline tariff applies to imports from nearly all countries, while China faces a cumulative duty rate of 145%, the highest in modern U.S. history[1][4][9]. These policies aim to reduce trade deficits, revive domestic manufacturing, and counter perceived unfair practices by trading partners. However, retaliatory measures from China and other nations, coupled with inflationary pressures, underscore the complex trade-offs of this strategy.  \n\n---\n\n### Agenda Item Description  \nThe Trade and Tariffs agenda item seeks to recalibrate global trade dynamics by establishing a minimum import duty structure and penalizing countries deemed to engage in non-reciprocal trade practices. Central to this effort is the imposition of a 10% universal baseline tariff on most imports, paired with escalating, country-specific surcharges targeting China. The policy leverages executive authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to address national security concerns linked to trade imbalances and intellectual property theft[10][14][17]. By layering tariffs, the administration aims to incentivize reshoring, reduce reliance on foreign supply chains, and generate revenue to offset domestic tax cuts[5][13].  \n\n---\n\n### Key Initiatives  \nThe administration has implemented a multi-pronged tariff framework. First, the 10% universal baseline tariff, effective April 5, 2025, applies to all imports except those from Canada and Mexico under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)[1][4][10]. Second, China-specific tariffs have been incrementally raised since February 2025, culminating in a 125% reciprocal duty announced on April 9, which stacks atop existing levies for a total effective rate of 145%[2][9][14]. Third, sector-specific tariffs of 25% target foreign automobiles, steel, and aluminum to protect critical industries[1][10][17]. Finally, the elimination of *de minimis* exemptions for low-value Chinese parcels disrupts cross-border e-commerce models reliant on duty-free shipping[2][8][17].  \n\n---\n\n### Status  \nAs of April 13, 2025, the 10% baseline tariff remains in effect for 154 countries, while 57 nations face higher reciprocal rates pending negotiations[14][17]. The 145% duty on Chinese goods has led to immediate supply chain disruptions, with U.S. retailers reporting a 15–30% surge in consumer prices for electronics and apparel[2][16]. Retaliatory measures from China include an 84% tariff on U.S. agricultural exports and export controls on rare earth minerals critical for defense and green energy technologies[6][9][12]. The administration has paused reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on allied nations like Japan and the E.U., contingent on progress in bilateral talks[1][9][16]. However, the 25% tariffs on foreign automobiles and steel imports took effect without exemptions, sparking legal challenges from automakers and construction firms[10][14][17].  \n\n---\n\n### Why It Matters  \n**Impact on Rights and Communities**: Higher import costs disproportionately affect low-income households, with the Tax Foundation estimating an average annual tax increase of $1,300 per U.S. family[13]. Small businesses reliant on Chinese manufacturing, such as retailers and tech startups, face existential risks due to eroded profit margins[2][8][16].  \n\n**National and Global Effects**: The tariffs have widened the U.S.-China trade rift, destabilizing global markets and triggering a 5% drop in the S&P 500 since April 1[16][17]. Domestically, the policies have spurred modest gains in steel and automotive production but failed to offset job losses in logistics and retail sectors[5][14].  \n\n**Economic and Legal Implications**: Yale economists project the tariffs will raise $3.1 trillion in revenue by 2035 but reduce GDP growth by 1.2% annually due to retaliatory measures[5]. Legal scholars argue the IEEPA’s use for economic—rather than national security—objectives sets a precedent for executive overreach[10][17].  \n\n---\n\n**Sources**: [1][2][4][5][6][9][10][12][13][14][16][17]\n---\n[1] https://geodis.com/us-en/blog/increasing-tariffs-how-protect-your-import-business\n\n[2] https://www.china-briefing.com/news/us-trump-tariffs-key-implications-for-chinas-ultra-fast-fashion/\n\n[3] https://www.hklaw.com/en/general-pages/trumps-2025-executive-orders-chart\n\n[4] https://www.timetrex.com/blog/us-tariffs-2025-analysis\n\n[5] https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/where-we-stand-fiscal-economic-and-distributional-effects-all-us-tariffs-enacted-2025-through-april\n\n[6] https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/04/04/china-imposes-retaliatory-34-tariff-on-imports-of-all-us-goods\n\n[7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariffs_in_the_second_Trump_administration\n\n[8] https://www.bookweb.org/news/overview-2025-tariffs-1631822\n\n[9] https://www.china-briefing.com/news/us-china-relations-in-the-trump-2-0-implications/\n\n[10] https://www.ashurst.com/en/insights/the-impact-of-the-new-wave-of-us-tariffs-on-global-businesses/\n\n[11] https://igrownews.com/trump-tariffs-effects-on-agriculture-agtech-investments/\n\n[12] https://www.manufacturingdive.com/news/trump-china-50-percent-tariff-threat/744642/\n\n[13] https://taxfoundation.org/research/federal-tax/trump-administration-tax-proposals/\n\n[14] https://semianalysis.com/2025/04/10/tariff-armageddon-gpu-loopholes/\n\n[15] https://drgnews.com/2025/04/03/trump-says-tariffs-on-canada-and-mexico-coming-saturday-and-hes-deciding-whether-to-tax-their-oil/\n\n[16] https://www.kiplinger.com/news/live/tax-season-2025-tips-information-updates\n\n[17] https://www.aprio.com/everything-included-in-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs-ins-article-intl/",
