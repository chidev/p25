  "content": "# Law Enforcement Expansion Under Project 2025: Death Penalty and Domestic Military Deployment  \n\nProject 2025’s agenda for law enforcement expansion centers on two interconnected pillars: the aggressive expansion of capital punishment and the integration of military strategies into domestic policing. These initiatives reflect a broader ideological shift toward punitive justice models and the erosion of traditional boundaries between civilian law enforcement and military operations. As of April 2025, the Trump administration and allied state legislatures have advanced policies that amplify the scope of the death penalty while redefining the role of the U.S. Armed Forces in addressing domestic security threats.  \n\n---\n\n## Progress**: 75/100  \n\n### Strategic Alignment with Executive and Legislative Actions  \nThe Trump administration has prioritized capital punishment as a cornerstone of its criminal justice agenda, leveraging executive orders and federal oversight to incentivize state-level reforms. On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed **Executive Order 14164**, which rescinded the Biden-era moratorium on federal executions and directed the Justice Department to “pursue the death penalty for all crimes of a severity demanding its use”[9][10]. This directive has galvanized legislative activity in Republican-led states, with Arizona, Florida, and Texas introducing bills to expand execution methods, broaden death-eligible offenses, and expedite capital trials[2][11]. Concurrently, Project 2025’s blueprint for militarized domestic surveillance has begun manifesting in Defense Department policies, including the **Restoring America’s Fighting Force** order, which abolishes diversity initiatives and redirects resources toward “irregular warfare” tactics for internal security[12][16].  \n\n---\n\n## Key Initiatives  \n\n### Expansion of Capital Punishment  \n1. **Legislative Efforts to Broaden Death-Eligible Crimes**  \n   State legislatures have introduced bills categorizing non-homicide offenses—such as drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and aggravated assault on law enforcement—as capital crimes. In Florida, proposed legislation (HB 2025-15) would make “capital sex trafficking” punishable by death, while Alabama’s SB 2025-07 mandates the death penalty for first-degree rape of victims under six years old[2]. These measures mirror the federal government’s push to apply capital punishment to offenses involving the murder of law enforcement officers, a priority underscored by Attorney General Pam Bondi’s February 2025 memorandum[10].  \n\n2. **Diversification of Execution Methods**  \n   To circumvent drug shortages and legal challenges to lethal injection, five states—Idaho, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Utah—have adopted firing squads as a primary or secondary execution method[11]. Idaho’s March 2025 law designates firing squad as the default method, marking the first state to abandon lethal injection entirely. South Carolina executed two prisoners by firing squad in March and April 2025, signaling a broader normalization of this practice[11].  \n\n3. **Accelerated Federal Review of Capital Cases**  \n   The Justice Department’s Capital Case Review Committee, established under Executive Order 14164, has reopened 37 federal death penalty cases that the Biden administration had previously declined to pursue[17]. This includes high-profile trials like *United States v. Richardson Dangleben Jr.*, where prosecutors reversed a 2024 decision to not seek death despite the defendant’s lack of access to mitigation experts[17].  \n\n### Militarization of Domestic Law Enforcement  \n1. **Integration of Military Strategies into Policing**  \n   Project 2025’s **Department of Defense** chapter advocates repurposing counterinsurgency tactics—such as intelligence gathering and targeted strikes—for domestic use against “anti-government” groups[12]. The January 2025 **Iron Dome for America** executive order allocates $2.1 billion to develop a missile defense shield and mandates closer collaboration between the Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on border security operations[16].  \n\n2. **Expansion of ICE Authority**  \n   The proposed dissolution of DHS and its replacement with a 100,000-strong immigration enforcement agency would empower ICE to conduct warrantless raids, detain undocumented immigrants indefinitely, and partner with local police under the 287(g) program[12][13]. This aligns with Executive Order 14165, which designates Mexican cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations, enabling military drone strikes against suspected members[16].  \n\n3. **Surveillance and Civic Monitoring**  \n   The **Traffic Safety For All** coalition, criticized by civil rights groups, has implemented AI-driven license plate readers and facial recognition systems in 12 major cities under the guise of reducing minor traffic stops[8]. These tools feed data into Fusion Centers, which Project 2025 envisions as hubs for monitoring political dissidents and activists[12].  \n\n---\n\n## Status  \n\n### Death Penalty Expansion  \n- **Federal Level**: The Justice Department has sought the death penalty in 19 cases since February 2025, including five against defendants charged with non-lethal drug offenses under the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act[14][10].  \n- **State Level**: Arizona and Texas passed laws reinstating mandatory death sentences for felony murder, overturning *Ring v. Arizona* (2002) precedents that required jury sentencing[2].  \n- **Execution Rates**: Eighteen executions have been carried out nationwide in 2025, a 125% increase from 2024. Firing squads account for 33% of these[11].  \n\n### Domestic Military Deployment  \n- **Border Operations**: The Pentagon has deployed 3,000 National Guard troops to assist ICE in constructing border walls and conducting mass arrests under Operation Secure Homeland[12][16].  \n- **Surveillance Programs**: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ **Homestead Project** has retrofitted military housing with biometric scanners and motion-tracking systems, marketed as “quality-of-life improvements” for service members[3].  \n- **Policy Shifts**: The **Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness** order expelled 1,200 transgender personnel and reallocated their $400 million budget to Cyber Command operations[16].  \n\n---\n\n## Why It Matters  \n\n### Impact on Civil Rights  \n1. **Racial Disparities in Capital Sentencing**  \n   Black defendants are 4.3 times more likely to receive death sentences than white defendants for comparable crimes, a disparity exacerbated by laws targeting “gang-related” offenses and drug trafficking[10][14].  \n\n2. **Criminalization of Marginalized Communities**  \n   ICE’s expanded authority has led to a 40% increase in deportations of LGBTQ asylum seekers, many fleeing violence in Honduras and Guatemala[13].  \n\n3. **Erosion of Privacy Protections**  \n   Military-grade surveillance tools, originally designed for overseas combat zones, now monitor U.S. neighborhoods, with communities of color facing 73% higher scrutiny rates[8][12].  \n\n### Systemic Risks  \n1. **Undermining Judicial Independence**  \n   The Justice Department’s reversal of no-death-penalty decisions in cases like *Dangleben* infringes on prosecutorial discretion, politicizing capital sentencing[17].  \n\n2. **Normalization of Extrajudicial Violence**  \n   Firing squad executions, though framed as pragmatic solutions to drug shortages, revive historical associations with lynching and militarized repression[11][14].  \n\n3. **Threats to Democratic Governance**  \n   Project 2025’s proposal to replace nonpartisan civil servants with political appointees enables unilateral policymaking, bypassing congressional oversight[12][13].  \n\n---\n\n**Sources**: [2][9][10][11][12][13][14][16][17]\n---\n[1] https://wacities.org/advocacy/News/advocacy-news/2025/03/17/the-much-discussed--100-million-for-law-enforcement-bill-gains-a-hearing\n\n[2] https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-and-research/data/recent-legislative-activity\n\n[3] https://www.army.mil/article/284154/fort_braggs_homestead_project_brings_91_million_investment_to_improve_military_housing\n\n[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media\n\n[5] https://mlk50.com/2025/03/17/trump-is-backing-away-from-police-reform-heres-what-that-means-for-12-cities/\n\n[6] https://www.army.mil/article/284533/update_lower_pool_10_restoration_project_groundbreaking_and_open_house_canceled\n\n[7] https://staticpacific.blob.core.windows.net/press-releases-attachments/3549321/NIO%20Inc%20-%20Annual%20Report.pdf\n\n[8] https://www.policingproject.org/news-main/2025/3/25/national-coalition-launched-to-modernize-traffic-enforcement-amp-safety\n\n[9] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States\n\n[10] https://capitalbnews.org/trump-executive-orders-black-americans/\n\n[11] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_by_firing_squad\n\n[12] http://resistingproject2025.org/key-proposals\n\n[13] https://glaad.org/project-2025/\n\n[14] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act\n\n[15] https://www.indy100.com/politics/trump/donald-trump-project-2025-heritage-foundation\n\n[16] https://www.hklaw.com/en/general-pages/trumps-2025-executive-orders-chart\n\n[17] https://stthomassource.com/content/2025/04/01/doj-dangleben-defense-tangle-over-death-penalty-being-back-on-table/",
