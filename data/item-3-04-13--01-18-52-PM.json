  "content": "# Project 2025 Tax Reform Agenda: Flat Tax and Corporate Tax Cuts  \nThe Trump administration and Project 2025 have advanced significant tax policy changes since January 2025, focusing on implementing a flat income tax system, slashing corporate tax rates, and introducing new consumption taxes. These reforms aim to simplify the tax code but disproportionately benefit wealthy individuals and corporations while increasing financial burdens on middle- and lower-income households. Legislative progress includes congressional approval of a $5.3 trillion deficit-financed budget framework, paving the way for corporate tax cuts and tariff hikes. However, these changes risk exacerbating income inequality, inflating the federal deficit, and raising costs for everyday goods.  \n\n---\n\n## Progress**: 75/100  \nThe Trump administration has secured critical legislative milestones to advance Project 2025’s tax agenda, including House passage of a budget resolution enabling $5.3 trillion in deficit spending for tax cuts[4][5][11]. Corporate tax reductions and flat tax proposals are now advancing through committee hearings, with draft legislation expected by May 2025[5]. However, opposition to regressive income tax hikes and tariff-induced price increases has slowed full implementation.  \n\n---\n\n### Agenda Item Description  \nProject 2025’s tax reforms seek to overhaul the U.S. tax system by replacing progressive income brackets with a flat tax, reducing corporate rates from 21% to 15%, and imposing a universal consumption tax[1][2][7]. Proponents argue these changes will simplify compliance and stimulate economic growth, but independent analyses project higher effective taxes for most households and a $4–$5 trillion increase in the federal deficit over the next decade[1][7][9].  \n\n---\n\n### Key Initiatives  \nThe administration is prioritizing three structural changes: **1)** A 15% flat income tax rate for individuals, eliminating the 10%, 12%, 22%, and 24% brackets, which would raise taxes for 62% of filers[1][7][12]. **2)** A corporate tax rate reduction to 15%, down from 21% established under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)[7][9][14]. **3)** A broad-based consumption tax on goods and services, paired with 60% tariffs on imported products to incentivize domestic manufacturing[1][7][11]. Additional measures include eliminating the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap and privatizing federal mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which could raise annual housing costs by $1,200 per household[7][8].  \n\n---\n\n### Status  \n**Legislative Advances**: The House adopted a Senate-amended budget resolution on April 10, 2025, authorizing $5.3 trillion in deficit spending to fund corporate tax cuts and temporary income tax reductions[4][5][11]. This bypasses the need for Democratic support through reconciliation rules.  \n**Executive Actions**: President Trump has directed federal agencies to prepare for Schedule F reclassification of civil service roles, enabling replacement of nonpartisan staff with appointees loyal to Project 2025’s agenda[2][8].  \n**Economic Projections**: The Peterson Institute estimates proposed tariffs will cost households $2,600 annually, neutralizing any benefits from income tax changes for middle-class families[1][7]. Meanwhile, the Tax Foundation warns that extending TCJA provisions could add $4.6 trillion to the national debt by 2035[9][12].  \n**Corporate Lobbying**: Major firms like AutoZone and PepsiCo have amplified advocacy for lower rates, leveraging a 39% decline in effective tax rates since 2017 despite profits doubling[14].  \n\n---\n\n### Why It Matters  \n**Household Impact**: A family earning $100,000 would pay $2,600 more annually under the flat tax, while a $5 million-earning household saves $325,000[1][7]. Consumption taxes and tariffs could further erode disposable income by $3,800 per year for median earners[1][11].  \n**Public Services**: The $4 trillion revenue shortfall from corporate cuts may trigger reductions to Medicare, Medicaid, and education funding[1][2][9]. North Carolina’s freeze on tax cuts for the wealthy—a model cited in Project 2025 debates—highlights how revenue preservation supports childcare, housing, and public sector wages[3][10].  \n**Economic Inequality**: Post-TCJA data shows corporations allocated 75% of tax savings to stock buybacks rather than wages, exacerbating wealth gaps[9][14]. Project 2025’s policies would intensify this trend, shifting $7.75 trillion to top earners by 2035[9][11].  \n**Legal Challenges**: Constitutional concerns persist over the administration’s use of reconciliation to bypass filibusters and its refusal to disclose compliance with congressional oversight mandates[2][5][8].  \n\n---\n\n**Sources**: [1][2][3][4][5][7][8][9][11][12][14]\n---\n[1] https://whatisproject2025.net/about-project-2025/\n\n[2] https://whatisproject2025.net\n\n[3] https://ncbudget.org/with-governors-recommended-budget-nc-could-choose-tax-cuts-for-working-families-over-enriching-corporations-and-the-wealthy-few/\n\n[4] https://taxfoundation.org/tags/budget-reconciliation/\n\n[5] https://www.kutakrock.com/newspublications/publications/2025/april/house-takes-critical-step-forward-for-tax-reform\n\n[6] https://www.hoover.org/research/simplifying-tax-system-history-flat-tax\n\n[7] https://whatisproject2025.net/project-2025-tax-impact/\n\n[8] https://redwine.blue/project2025/\n\n[9] https://pro.bloombergtax.com/insights/federal-tax/what-is-the-future-of-the-tcja/\n\n[10] https://council.nyc.gov/budget/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2025/04/Fiscal-2026-Preliminary-Budget-Response-FINAL.pdf\n\n[11] https://taxfoundation.org/research/federal-tax/trump-administration-tax-proposals/\n\n[12] https://taxfoundation.org/tags/tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-tcja/\n\n[13] https://thoughtleadership.rbc.com/prince-edward-island-budget-2025-entering-a-period-of-deeper-deficits/\n\n[14] https://www.commondreams.org/news/household-goods-tax-cuts-groundwork-collaborative",
