  "content": "# Abortion and Reproductive Rights Restrictions: Criminalizing Abortion Drugs and Limiting Federal Funding**  \n## Progress**: 45/100  \n---\n\nProject 2025’s agenda seeks to severely restrict access to abortion and reproductive health care by criminalizing abortion medications, defunding providers like Planned Parenthood, and reinstating policies that limit contraceptive access for low-income communities. Grounded in anti-abortion ideology and fetal personhood frameworks, these measures aim to eliminate federal support for abortion-related services, block telehealth access to medication abortion, and empower states to prosecute individuals seeking or providing care. The agenda aligns with broader efforts to codify the belief that life begins at conception, which would effectively ban most abortions and threaten IVF and contraception[4][9][13].  \n\n---\n\n## Key Initiatives  \n- **Defund Title X Family Planning Program**: Withhold federal grants from clinics offering abortion referrals or promoting health equity, disproportionately impacting Planned Parenthood[1][3][12].  \n- **Reinstate Domestic \"Gag Rule\"**: Bar clinics receiving federal funds from discussing abortion as an option, even if using non-federal resources[1][3][9].  \n- **Criminalize Medication Abortion**: Reverse FDA approval of mifepristone, ban mailing abortion pills, and prosecute providers under the Comstock Act[4][7][14].  \n- **Promote Fetal Personhood Laws**: Legally equate embryos with people, enabling states to charge pregnant individuals for abortion-related \"homicide\"[2][9][13].  \n- **Expand Surveillance**: Create a national database tracking abortions, including patient demographics and methods used, to enforce restrictions[5][9][13].  \n\n---\n\n## Status  \n- **Title X Funding Frozen**: In March 2025, the Trump administration suspended $27.5 million in grants to 22 clinics, including all Planned Parenthood affiliates, citing noncompliance with anti-DEI executive orders[1][3][12].  \n- **DOJ Limits FACE Act Enforcement**: A February 2025 memo prohibits new prosecutions of anti-abortion activists for clinic blockades unless approved by leadership, emboldening harassment[8][14].  \n- **State Criminalization Bills**: Legislation in 12 states (e.g., Alabama, Texas) proposes charging patients and providers with homicide, punishable by life imprisonment or death[13][14].  \n- **FDA Reviewing Mifepristone**: The administration is pressuring the FDA to revoke approval for telehealth prescriptions, which account for 60% of abortions[7][14].  \n\n---\n\n## Why It Matters  \n- **Your Rights**: Pregnant individuals could face prosecution for miscarriage, stillbirth, or seeking abortion care, eroding bodily autonomy[2][9][13].  \n- **Your Community**: Clinic closures (1 in 4 left Title X under Trump’s first term) reduce access to cancer screenings, STI testing, and contraception, worsening public health[1][3][12].  \n- **Your Country**: 75 million women of reproductive age risk losing access to abortion, with disproportionate harm to Black, Latino, and rural communities[5][9][12].  \n- **Economy & Wages**: Loss of Medicaid coverage for 40% of births and SNAP cuts would deepen poverty, particularly for single mothers[5][12].  \n- **Legality & Ethics**: Fetal personhood laws could criminalize IVF, emergency abortions, and birth control while violating patient privacy through surveillance[4][9][13].  \n\n---  \n**Sources**: [1][2][3][4][5][7][8][9][12][13][14]\n---\n[1] https://www.kff.org/quick-take/trumps-federal-funding-freeze-may-reach-the-title-x-family-planning-program/\n\n[2] https://reproaction.org/criminalizing-abortion-2025/\n\n[3] https://www.guttmacher.org/2025/04/trump-administrations-withholding-funds-could-impact-30-percent-title-x-patients\n\n[4] https://redwine.blue/project2025/\n\n[5] https://elcentralmedia.com/the-battle-ahead-latino-civil-rights-vs-project-2025/\n\n[6] https://glaad.org/project-2025/\n\n[7] https://jacobin.com/2025/04/trump-abortion-mifepristone-shield-laws\n\n[8] https://reproductivefreedomforall.org/resources/all-the-attacks-on-reproductive-freedom-under-trumps-second-term/\n\n[9] https://nationalpartnership.org/report/project-2025-threatens-women-and-families-health-and-freedom/\n\n[10] https://laist.com/brief/news/health/trump-froze-out-project-2025-in-his-campaign-now-its-blueprint-is-his-healthcare-playbook\n\n[11] https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/what-happens-to-health-research-when-women-and-diversity-are-banned-words\n\n[12] https://tcf.org/content/report/state-of-maternal-health-2025/\n\n[13] https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/south-texas-el-paso/news/2025/04/12/anti-abortion-group-wants-women-to-face-criminal-charges\n\n[14] https://baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2025/03/28/president-trump-abortion-action-planned-parenthood-students-for-life-defund\n\n[15] https://thefulcrum.us/rule-of-law/defund-planned-parenthood-news",
