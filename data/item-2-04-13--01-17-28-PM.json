  "content": "# Environmental Policy Rollbacks: Exiting Paris Agreement and Promoting Fossil Fuels  \n**Progress**: 70/100  \n\n---\n\n## Agenda Item Description  \nThe Environmental Policy Rollbacks agenda item under Project 2025 aims to dismantle federal climate regulations, withdraw the United States from international climate agreements, and prioritize fossil fuel production as part of a broader strategy to reduce regulatory burdens on industry and assert \"energy dominance.\" This agenda seeks to overturn Biden-era climate policies, including the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy incentives, and reverse decades of environmental protections tied to air quality, emissions, and renewable energy adoption. By exiting the Paris Agreement and defunding climate initiatives, the administration intends to refocus national priorities on economic growth and fossil fuel expansion, arguing that previous climate policies imposed undue costs on businesses and households[4][9][10][12].  \n\n---\n\n## Key Initiatives  \nThe agenda’s key initiatives include formally withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement, repealing the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, slashing funding for renewable energy programs, and expanding oil, gas, and coal production through subsidies and streamlined permitting. Additional measures involve withdrawing from international climate finance mechanisms like the Green Climate Fund and the Loss and Damage Fund, dismantling the EPA’s enforcement capabilities via staff reductions, and rescinding vehicle emissions standards to favor internal combustion engines[1][4][7][8][10][12].  \n\n---\n\n## Status  \nAs of April 2025, the Trump administration has initiated the one-year withdrawal process from the Paris Agreement, with full exit slated for January 2026[12]. The EPA has proposed 31 major deregulatory actions, including revisiting the 2009 Endangerment Finding (which authorizes GHG regulation) and rolling back methane leak limits for oil and gas operations, tailpipe emissions standards, and coal plant emission guidelines[1][4][13]. Over $20 billion in clean energy grants under the Inflation Reduction Act have been frozen or canceled, including hydrogen hub funding and lead pipe replacement programs, while the Department of Energy has flagged additional cuts to long-duration energy storage and industrial decarbonization projects[8][11]. The U.S. has also exited the Loss and Damage Fund board and withdrawn from the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), halting $20 billion in pledged support for coal-dependent nations[4][10]. Fossil fuel subsidies, estimated at $1.5 trillion globally in 2023, remain intact in the U.S., with ongoing advocacy to expand oil and gas infrastructure[3][7].  \n\n---\n\n## Why It Matters  \n**Public Health**: Repealing air and water quality rules could lead to 200,000 premature deaths over 25 years and 10,000 daily asthma attacks due to increased particulate matter and toxic emissions[11]. **Economic Costs**: Household energy bills are projected to rise by $110 annually by 2026 if clean energy incentives are repealed, while climate-driven disasters like wildfires and floods could exacerbate insurance and infrastructure costs[11][12]. **Global Leadership**: The U.S. exit from the Paris Agreement undermines international climate cooperation, emboldening fossil fuel-dependent nations and risking delayed global emissions reductions[9][12]. **Environmental Damage**: Rolling back methane regulations and coal plant rules could add 200 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions annually, worsening climate impacts such as extreme heat and sea-level rise[4][13]. **Legal and Ethical Risks**: Defunding enforcement programs and granting polluters exemptions from Clean Air Act compliance erode accountability, disproportionately harming low-income and minority communities reliant on federal protections[4][11].  \n\n---\n\n**Sources**: [1][4][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]\n---\n[1] https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2025/04/what-brown-experts-ri-officials-think-about-the-epas-planned-climate-rollbacks\n\n[2] https://climatefundsupdate.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/CFF11-2025-ENG-GCF-DIGITAL.pdf\n\n[3] https://influencemap.org/briefing/Fossil-Fuel-Bulletin-March-2025\n\n[4] https://www.dlapiper.com/en-us/insights/publications/horizon/2025/horizon-esg-regulatory-news-and-trends-march-2025\n\n[5] https://climate-xchange.org/2025/04/webinar-recap-epas-climate-rollbacks-and-how-states-can-fill-the-gaps/\n\n[6] https://www.britannica.com/topic/Paris-Agreement-2015/Negotiations-and-agreement\n\n[7] https://www.iisd.org/articles/insight/cost-fossil-fuel-reliance-governments-provided-15-trillion-2023\n\n[8] https://www.mintz.com/insights-center/viewpoints/2236/2025-04-02-energy-sustainability-washington-update-april-2025\n\n[9] https://www.ehn.org/trump-accelerates-dismantling-of-u-s-climate-policies\n\n[10] https://time.com/7271567/trump-project-2025-anti-climate-action/\n\n[11] https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-04-05/trump-is-gutting-the-nations-environmental-programs-heres-how-much-it-will-cost-americans\n\n[12] https://www.climatebusiness.africa/trump-withdraws-us-from-paris-climate-agreement-on-first-day-of-second-term/\n\n[13] https://ctmirror.org/2025/03/27/epa-environmental-rollbacks-ct-effects/",
