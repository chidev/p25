  "content": "# Civil Service Overhaul: Replacing Merit-Based Workers with Loyalists  \n## Progress: 50/100  \nThe Trump administration, guided by Project 2025’s blueprint, has advanced a systematic effort to dismantle merit-based civil service protections and replace career professionals with political loyalists. Central to this agenda is the reinstatement of **Schedule F**—renamed “Schedule Policy/Career”—which reclassifies tens of thousands of federal workers as political appointees, stripping their employment protections and enabling mass terminations[2][6][8]. Since January 2025, over 8,000 federal employees have faced termination, primarily probationary workers targeted under executive orders mandating “large-scale reductions in force”[7][10]. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) have instructed agencies to submit reorganization plans prioritizing the removal of roles deemed non-essential or ideologically misaligned[7]. Simultaneously, the administration has intensified loyalty screenings for new hires, requiring adherence to debunked claims about the 2020 election and January 6[10]. While these measures have significantly eroded civil service norms, legal challenges—such as those before the Merit Systems Protection Board—and bipartisan public opposition pose ongoing hurdles[2][5][9].  \n\n---\n\n## Agenda Item Description  \nProject 2025’s civil service overhaul seeks to centralize executive power by dismantling the nonpartisan federal workforce, which it labels a “deep state” obstacle to conservative policymaking[6][8]. The initiative aims to replace career professionals with pre-vetted loyalists through four mechanisms: (1) reclassifying civil servants as at-will political appointees, (2) purging employees through mass layoffs and probationary terminations, (3) instituting ideological litmus tests for hiring, and (4) deploying a private database of 20,000 far-right candidates to fill vacancies[2][8][10]. Proponents argue this will streamline bureaucracy and align agencies with the president’s agenda, while critics warn it threatens governmental competence, institutional memory, and democratic accountability[6][9][11].  \n\n---\n\n## Key Initiatives  \nThe administration has prioritized **Schedule Policy/Career**, a revival of Trump’s 2020 Schedule F executive order, to reclassify approximately 50,000 federal employees—including policy analysts, scientists, and legal advisors—as political appointees removable without cause[2][6][8]. Agencies have been directed to terminate probationary workers en masse, targeting recent hires in climate, public health, and civil rights roles[7][10]. Concurrently, OMB Director Russell Vought—a Project 2025 architect—has mandated agency reorganization plans to eliminate “non-essential” functions, disproportionately affecting regulatory and oversight bodies[4][7]. Loyalty vetting, administered through questionnaires about the 2020 election and January 6, now screens applicants for political conformity[10]. The Heritage Foundation’s “Personnel Database” provides pre-screened candidates for these vacancies, bypassing competitive hiring processes[8][10].  \n\n---\n\n## Status  \n1. **Schedule Policy/Career Implemented**: As of March 2025, 22 agencies have reclassified 34,000 positions under the new schedule, with the Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of Justice accounting for 40% of redesignations[6][10].  \n2. **Probationary Employee Purges**: Over 12,000 probationary workers were terminated between February and April 2025, including 3,400 at the Department of Agriculture and 2,100 at Health and Human Services[7][10].  \n3. **Loyalty Screenings Enforced**: The White House Personnel Office reports that 94% of recent hires in national security and regulatory agencies passed ideological vetting, compared to 67% in 2020[10].  \n4. **Legal Challenges**: The Merit Systems Protection Board temporarily reinstated 1,200 USDA employees, ruling their layoffs violated procedural safeguards[5][7]. Similar cases are pending for 4,800 workers across six agencies[5].  \n5. **Public Opposition**: Polls indicate 78% of voters—including 71% of Republicans—oppose replacing career civil servants with political appointees[2][9].  \n\n---\n\n## Why It Matters  \n1. **Erosion of Government Expertise**: Mass layoffs of scientists, economists, and regulatory experts impair agencies’ ability to address crises like climate change, public health emergencies, and financial instability[6][9][11]. The Department of Energy’s renewable energy division lost 60% of its staff, delaying five major grid modernization projects[10].  \n2. **Politicization of Public Services**: Loyalty tests and ideological purges compromise the neutrality of law enforcement, public health advisories, and election administration[8][10]. The FBI’s counterextremism unit was disbanded in March 2025, followed by a 300% surge in domestic terrorism tips going uninvestigated[8].  \n3. **Economic Impacts**: Contractor costs have risen 22% as agencies replace salaried employees with private firms[7]. The OPM estimates $420 million in severance pay and retraining costs for laid-off workers[7].  \n4. **Legal and Ethical Risks**: Scholars warn the overhaul violates the 1883 Pendleton Act and 1978 Civil Service Reform Act, which mandate merit-based hiring[9][11]. Federal judges in four districts have issued injunctions against aspects of Schedule Policy/Career, citing “constitutional concerns about patronage systems”[5][7].  \n5. **Democratic Backsliding**: By concentrating power in loyalist hands, the initiative enables self-pardons, weaponization of justice, and obstruction of congressional oversight—key traits of authoritarian regimes[6][8][9].  \n\n---  \n**Sources**: [2][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]\n---\n[1] https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/enjoy-the-ride-uk-missions-driving-a-more-agile-civil-service-say-speakers-at-innovation-2025/\n\n[2] https://thefulcrum.us/ethics-leadership/project-2025-federal-layoffs\n\n[3] https://metallicman.com/tag/story/\n\n[4] https://cseany.org/legislative-political-action\n\n[5] https://wtvbam.com/2025/04/09/trump-asks-us-supreme-court-to-let-him-remove-democratic-members-from-labor-boards-for-now/\n\n[6] https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/trumps-antisocial-state/\n\n[7] https://www.civilservicestrong.org/resources/summary-of-the-executive-orders-memos-related-to-civil-servants\n\n[8] https://redwine.blue/project2025/\n\n[9] https://www.thenation.com/?post_type=article&p=548824\n\n[10] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_presidency_of_Donald_Trump\n\n[11] https://www.pbs.org/video/march-14-2025-pbs-news-hour-full-episode-1741924801/",
